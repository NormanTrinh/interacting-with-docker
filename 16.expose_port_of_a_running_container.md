# Example:
Launch a web-service that listens on port 80, but do **not** expose its internal port 80 (oops!):
```shell
docker run -ti mkodockx/docker-pastebin   # Forgot to expose PORT 80!
```
Find its Docker network IP:
```bash
docker inspect 63256f72142a | grep IPAddress
```
output
```text
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
```
Launch alpine/socat with port 8080 exposed, and get it to forward TCP traffic to that IP's port 80:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:1234 alpine/socat TCP-LISTEN:1234,fork TCP-CONNECT:172.17.0.2:80
```
You can now access pastebin on http://localhost:8080/, and your requests goes to socat:1234 which forwards it to pastebin:80, and the response travels the same path in reverse.
